## Unlock bootloader

Unlock bootloader[2]:

* Charge your phone to 100%;
* Connect your phone in LG software mode
  (every mode with an activated adb should work, too);
* Run `adb reboot oem-unlock`
* **ATTENTION**: there is no further warning, your whole `/data/` partition will be formatted!  
  Press the volume up button;
* Wait for the unlocking to finish;
* Pull out your usb cable and your battery, too;
* Put your battery back in and boot;
* Set up your system;
* Now go to the hidden menu, dial `3845#*880#`;
* Check your bootloader status (`Bootloader Unlock Check` --> `Bootloader Unlock Check` --> `Unlock`).

If you did not succeed, try the alternative method in [2].

## Flash recovery

Now flash the recovery image you just downloaded:

* `adb reboot bootloader`;
* `fastboot devices` and make sure your device is listed;
* `fastboot flash recovery TWRP_multirom_p880_*.img`;
* Select recovery (using volume down);
* Enter recovery (using volume up).
* Reboot

* `adb reboot recovery`;
* Install zip -> `omni-4.4.4-*-p880-NIGHTLY.zip`;
* Wipe data/factory reset;
* Do **not** reboot yet.

##  Flash Gapps
